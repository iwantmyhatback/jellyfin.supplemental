# jellyfin.supplemental/python

The Python content for this script set. Contains the data querying and processing as well as the Gmail API utilization for email sending.

### gmail.py

Uses configuration files from `<repoRoot>/configuration/info*.json` and credentials from `<repoRoot>/.credentials/` to connect to Gmail via the API and send an email.

### htmlProcessing.py

Processes the compiled media information into HTML (table-based responsive email layout) and plain text, returning both to `<repoRoot>/python/main.py` for the email body.

### jellyfin.py

Connects to and queries information from Jellyfin using the auto-generated `jellyfin_api` package (Pydantic models, attribute access). Handles authentication, media queries, remote image lookups, and data extraction. The `jellyfin_api` package is generated by `openapi-generator-cli` from the Jellyfin server's OpenAPI spec during `<repoRoot>/shell/main.sh` execution.

### main.py

Orchestrates all Python execution: queries Jellyfin for recent movies and series, generates HTML email content, and sends via Gmail.

### utilities.py

Small utility functions used across the other Python files.
